## test notebook

This container looks a lot like the [base notebook](https://github.com/uwcip/jupyterhub-base-notebook)
but with a few differences. This notebook only builds to "latest" so that it
can be used to test new features in the container before they go into the base
notebook for everyone else to get.

If you make changes to this notebook you must build and push them manually as
no GitHub Actions will create new versions of this container.
